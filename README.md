# Hindi News Fake Detection & Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
With the rise of misinformation, it is crucial to have an effective system for detecting fake news. This project focuses on detecting fake Hindi news using various machine learning models and analyzing their performance. 

## 🚀 Features
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing Hindi news datasets.
- **Fake News Detection**: Implementing and evaluating multiple models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - Naïve Bayes
- **Model Analysis**: Comparing performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Result Visualization**: Graphical representation of model comparisons.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK
- **Dataset**: Hindi Fake News Dataset (Custom)

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset containing real and fake Hindi news.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Text cleaning (removing stop words, special characters, tokenization)
   - Vectorization using TF-IDF/ CountVectorizer
3. **Model Implementation**:
   - Train & test multiple ML models
   - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal results
4. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Compare models using precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Use visualization for better understanding

## 📈 Results
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| SVM | **89%** | 88% | 90% | **89%** |
| Random Forest | 87% | 85% | 86% | 85.5% |
| Naïve Bayes | 73% | 81% | 80% | 80.5% |
| Linear Regression | 85% | 74% | 72% | 73% |

**Conclusion:** SVM performed the best among all tested models.
